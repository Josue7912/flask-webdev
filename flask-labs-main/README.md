# Flask Web Development

This repository contains code examples for CodingNomad's Flask web development course.

The following information is meant to help you if you are unsure about how to use or navigate this repository. See the [bottom section](#how-to-work-on-the-labs).

## The Rundown

This repository is structured as follows:

- **Top Level Directories:** These are the folders containing individual lab projects. They correspond to sections in the online course content.
  - **Subdirectories:** These are the individual labs you will complete as you go through the course.
    - **Story:** Each lab has a story behind it. Who doesn't like a good story with drama and character development? Especially when the character doing the most development and experiencing the most growth is *you!*
    - **Steps:** Most labs contain multiple steps to help you break down the problems you shall face. They go in approximate order of completion and contain *specifications* that you should do your best to follow.

## How To Work On The Labs

Some recommended tips on how to get through the labs:

- When you are ready to begin a lab, you'll look in the top-level folder matching the name of the section you're in to find the next lab. *You can open these individual lab folders with your IDE when you start each one.* Each one is an entire project!
- You should make regular commits. *It's highly recommended you commit your code each time you complete a Step*, at the least. See **Steps** above.
- *Relax!* If you get lost or overwhelmed, you can always ask for guidance on our [forum](https://forum.codingnomads.co/c/courses/flask-webdev/33). You can also seek help from your CodingNomads mentor, if you have one.
- Is something too confusing or ambiguous? Submit an [issue](https://github.com/CodingNomads/flask-labs/issues) with whatever you think could use some clarification. We want to make things easier for you! And you'll be helping future students understand the problems.

*Keep On Flasking*
