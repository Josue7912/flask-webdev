# Fix the Routes

Your friend Emily is one of those crazy dog lovers, and crazy enough that she started her own business to sell her own line of dog costumes. And it so happens she's learning Flask and wants to build her website with it! She's come to you for help as she is getting stuck with routes. She thought she knew what she was doing but *may* have skipped a few important points...

Anyway, you've learned about **routes in Flask** and can definitely help her out. She only has a few simple routes as she's deciding what she might want the website to look like. However, they aren't working yet. She wants your help in exchange for a dog costume for your dog Louie. Even though she got your dog's name wrong, you decide to help.

## Instructions

Your task is to get each of the routes working, meaning no errors.

You should be able to access:

- the index page at `localhost:5000/`
- the services page at `localhost:5000/services`
- costume pages at
  - `localhost:5000/costumes/skeleton`
  - `localhost:5000/costumes/dracula`
  - and at least 100 more costume pages of whatever you can imagine

Hint: No, you don't have to test that 102 different costume pages work, but you will have to test a few. ;)
